# Rock-Paper-Scissors-using-TFOD-API-object-detection


The notebooks numberes as 1,2 are ccloned from this repository : https://github.com/nicknochnack/TFODCourse.git

These are are actual steps which we need to follow to achieve custom object detection.

Nicholas Rennote - (https://github.com/nicknochnack) has made this task so much easier by writing all the steps in the form of code in a noetbook.
And im able to undertand TFOD from his youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U , and i stongly recommend everyone to watch it.

You can perform transfer learning for any pretrained model available in the tensorflow-zoo models.

To improve the models performance, these steps will be helpful : 
      increase the number of epochs, 
      increase the training data/images
      choose more accuarate trained model from the tensorflow-zoo models repo.
